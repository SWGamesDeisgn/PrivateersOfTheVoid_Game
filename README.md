# PrivateersOfTheVoid_Game
Test repository for my unity game project

Created to serve as a "dump" test of the unity gitignore file and also to test whether the entire project could be stored on github, if sucessful then it would make revisioning much easier and cleaner for me, and also make it easier to keep track of further changes to the project. Files may require clean up.
