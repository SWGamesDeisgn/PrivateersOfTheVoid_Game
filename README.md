# PrivateersOfTheVoid_Game
This is now the primary repository for my Unity game project.

The scripts contained within were all created for my game project. 
Many of the scripts are currently being reworked to be more professional or efficient.
This is because the project was started a few years ago and I have learned much since, which also means that my approach to programming has changed quite a lot since the start. 
This resulted in the requirement of having to alter many of the earlier scripts that I had written for this project. There will likely also be a folder containing old scripts that are depreciated eventually.

As a note the project makes use of a webGL template by SIMMER.IO to handle resizing of the game inside of a web browser.
